Matrix facets to consider:
	1. Sparsity
	2. Diagonality
	3. Symmetry
	4. Constant diagonals (Toeplitz)
	5. Invertibility
	6. Triangularity (closely related to sparsity)

When seeking to solve a linear system, the question of invertibility arises.
The naive way to check for invertibility is to ask about nonzero determinant.
Strang dislikes determinants (loss of meaning, difficult to compute?).
A more straightforward approach can be to use row reduction (Guassian elimination?).
In using elimination, we seek to make the matrix upper triangular.
That is, we want to "clean out" (make zero) entries beneath the diagonal.
To do so, move down the matrix one row at a time.
For each row after the top, make one additional rightward column a 0.
That is, for second row, make first entry zero. For third row, two zeros, etc.
To accomplish that, multiply scale above row by constant factor.
Choose the factor such that +/- current row and row makes target entry a 0.
Once the matrix is upper triangular, determinant is simply product of diagonal entries.
Thus, the matrix is invertible if all diagonal entries are nonzero when it's upper triangular.
