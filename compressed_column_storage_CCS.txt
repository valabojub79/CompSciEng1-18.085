Analogous to compressed row storage, but giving columns priority.
If a CRS format encodes matrix A, same encoding interpreted as CCS gives A-transpose.
Consists of 3 arrays:
	1. val: Nonzero values (matrix entries)
	2. row_ind
		a. Array of same length as first.
		b. Integer values representing index (1-based) of row for each value in array 1.
	3. col_ptr
		a. Of length equal to 1 + number of columns of matrix encoded.
		b. Each entry is (1-based) index into array 1 (nonzero matrix values).
		c. Each entry indicates which nonzero value is the first in its column.
		d. Empty column(s) indicated by repeated value.
		e. Start at 1, end at 1 + #(nonzero entries) = length(arr1)?
