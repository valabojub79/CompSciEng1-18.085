Matrices are **operators** on vectors.
Special matrices:
	1. K
	2. C
	3. T
	4. B

Special matrix K:
	- Symmetric
	- Sparse
	- Tridiagonal
	- Constant diagonals
	- Invertible
	- Positive definite
K has 2s on main diagonal, -1s on surrounding diagonals (bands).
K family is **second difference** matrices.

Changing southwest and northwest corners to -1 makes K circulant, noninvertible.
That circulant matrix is C.
Singular <--> Non-invertible <--> 0-determinant.
Columns of C all add to 0-column.
Nonzero solution n null space <--> singular, etc.
u = (c, c, c, ...) in null space is like arbitrary constant C in calculus.
That constant isn't knowable from derivative when we integrate.
Similarly, constant vector in null space isn't knowable from Cu = 0.

In practice, determinant is poor way to compute inverse.
Instead, do elimination and look for nonzero pivots on main diagonal.

Difference between *invertible* and *positive definite*:
1. *Invertible* means *nonzero pivots*.
2. *Positive definite* means *positive pivots*.
3. *Invertible* matrix has all *nonzero eigenvalues*.
4. *Positive definite* symmetric matrix has all *positive eigenvalues*.

Circulant positive semidefiniteness:
C is singular because when row-reduced, it's last row is all-0.
This means C has (n-1) positivive eigenvalues, but 1 0 eigenvalue.
C is *positive semidefinite*.
